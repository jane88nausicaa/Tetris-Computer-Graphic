## Functionality
The game has the following functionality: 
- Moving the falling block by moving the mouse
- When the cursor is outside of “Main area”, each click on the left mouse button moves the falling shape to the left by one square, and similarly, the right button moves the shape to the right by one square. A forward scroll of the mouse wheel will rotate the shape clockwise and a backward scroll will rotate the shape counter-clockwise. 
- Moving mouse cursor inside the main area on the left to stop the game.
- Pressing `QUIT` to quit the game
- Changing of the window dimension will only change the size, but not the relative position and aspect ratio of any component. 
- Changing the parameters of the game:
 -- M – scoring factor (range: 1-10).
 -- N – number of rows required for each Level of difficulty (range: 20-50).
 -- S – speed factor (range: 0.1-1.0).
